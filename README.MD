# ðŸ§ª Telegram-Inspired Profile Screen (XML + Java)

## ðŸš€ What is this?

A custom implementation of a Telegram-style profile screen â€” built completely from scratch using **XML**, **Java**, and **a lot of improvisation**.

I didnâ€™t have the hardware to build Telegram Android from source, so I decided to recreate the profile UI on my own â€” animations, scroll behavior, sticker views, and all.

## ðŸ§  How it works

- **Scroll listener** detects vertical movement and triggers view animations
- **ObjectAnimator** handles opacity, scale, and translation for collapsing/expanding
- **Radians + sin/cos** place `ImageView`s evenly around a circle
